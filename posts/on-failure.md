Reality hits me hard toward my face. My dream collapse within a second and leaving it nothing except a misery. What I have seen is beyond my imagination. It is beyond my control. A rejection from reality makes me miserable. But, this feeling only last a second. Because this feeling just a feeling and its reality it is what it is.
August 14, 2020. I got rejected by university I want to attend. By university that become my dream all night long throughout a year back. I always dreamed to become one of the student in great university in my country Indonesia. T
o attend in historical university and shared one dream with others to attend in the same university makes me enthusiastic. But I know. I have to make sacrifice to get accepted by my dream university. Time always comes first in my mind. Then, energy and thought to study hard for tackle hard question in exams. Those sacrifice I thought good enough to make my dream become reality and alive. But no. I got rejection.
There are many questions I’ve always ask to myself. Am I not good enough? Am I just a mediocre person? Am I not the chosen one among others? Am I to selfish? Within my contemplation about failure I always ask to myself what weaknesses I have that makes me got rejection. And me myself can’t answer the question itself. I’m desperate. The rejection ghosting me all day now like I’m dreaming about it all year.
Then I rest. Closing my eyes and trying not to open it again. But I can’t. My inner thought always thinking about a happy ending even though I don’t know what kind of happy ending is. I just follow order from my inner thought to always survive no matter what hard reality hits my face.In the time of desperation, in the edge of life itself, I can’t help myself not to thinking about happy ending. I’m choosing to always dream big. But to dream big I have to sacrifice more. I have to sacrifice more failures. In the life of uncertainty, there is always an option. In my experience of rejection there are two options: to always be miserable and crying all night long thinking about failure or to get up and chasing another dream big. I choose the latter.
