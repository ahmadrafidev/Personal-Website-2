## **Introduction** 👋

Hello! My name is Ahmad Rafi Wirana. Everyone call me Rafi.
Currently, I'm a sophomore Computer Science Student in University of Indonesia. I am an aspiring Software Engineer. Besides doing college, the things I do
are Competitive Programming, side gig Data Science, snake on Ethical Hacking,
and a rookie in Mobile Development. I built this website on summer holiday
of 2021 because I am very aware that I will do nothing in this holiday but
I do not want my time wasted. That's the origin of this so personal website.

## **Motivation for this website**

For me, it's very personal reason. My motivation to make this website
is a manifestation as an aspiring software engineer. I want to make my
very first portfolio for my journey as an software engineer. I also find out
website is easy to access for every human on earth and that's the opportunity for me to
keep all my portfolio and blog in one website platform so everyone can see it
from anywhere. That's the real very personal reason.

## **How this website was built**

This website is the result of my learning of Next JS. Because
I don't want to feel like looping in tutorial hell, so I just made this
website for myself as a learning by doing. For styling, in early production I made it with manual CSS and that's really complicated.
So I changed it with Tailwind CSS and my life was easier. 😄

## **Hope for the web and closing👌**

Over the time, I hope I can mantain this website as long as i can
during my college time. In the near future, I will add more features on this website so I can learn more about web development.
I am so excited to finally have a medium for sharing my thought and experience
in my own platform.

Thanks for reading this post!👋✌🏻
Peace out.
